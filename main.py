# ---- Bannerlord: launching BLSE under Proton -------------------------------
# BLSE is the centre of Bannerlord modding - ButterLib, UIExtenderEx and MCM
# all require it - and for a month it looked unusable under Proton. All three
# of its entry points died identically:
#
#   System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type of field
#   '...LauncherExceptionHandler:_harmony' due to: Could not load file or
#   assembly '0Harmony, Version=2.2.2.0'
#
# Mono JITs Program.Main and resolves the field's type EAGERLY, before BLSE's
# own assembly resolver (which knows to look in Modules/Bannerlord.Harmony)
# has been registered. Windows' CLR defers that resolution, which is why the
# same binaries work there. Copying Harmony's assemblies next to BLSE starts
# it, but then Harmony warns "loaded from another location... Expect issues!"
# in a dialog on every launch.
#
# The fix, measured on device 2026-08-19: MONO_PATH. Mono's own search-path
# variable, honoured by wine-mono, pointed at the Harmony MODULE's bin dir -
# so the assembly loads before JIT needs it, and from exactly the path the
# Harmony module expects, which also silences the warning. Control run threw;
# both path forms (Z:/forward and Z:\\back) survived.
#
# Delivery is a script rather than an env var in the launch options, because
# the game path contains spaces and decky-launch-options tokenizes launch
# options naively - a quoted MONO_PATH="..." gets split and half-lifted (the
# Fallout 3 d=$(dirname...) incident, same mechanism). The script lives at a
# NO-SPACE path, computes the game root from the arguments Steam passes, and
# execs the swapped exe. Launch options are then just:
#
#   <runtime_dir>/launch-blse.sh %command%
#
# No '=' anywhere, nothing to mangle, and identical behaviour on vanilla
# Steam. If Harmony's module is missing the script launches VANILLA rather
# than swapping to an exe that cannot start - a missing dependency must
# degrade to an unmodded boot, never an unbootable game.

# ---- Frostbite games (Star Wars Battlefront II) -----------------------------
# These games do not read loose files. Mods are .fbmod archives that have to be
# COMPILED into a "ModData" tree, and the game is then pointed at that tree.
# Doing that on Linux needed FrostyCli built for linux-x64 plus a patch of ours
# (see docs/frosty-swbf2/WORKING.md): the bundle format Battlefront II uses was
# unimplemented upstream, and four data-corruption bugs had to be fixed.
#
# Consequences for this plugin, all of them different from every other game:
#
#   - There is no per-mod install. Installing, enabling or disabling ANYTHING
#     means recompiling ModData from the whole enabled set.
#   - The game is redirected with GAME_DATA_DIR in the Wine prefix registry.
#     Not launch options: EA's launcher respawns the game and strips them.
#   - Compiling takes a couple of minutes and hundreds of MB, so it is worth
#     saying so rather than looking hung.

# activation manifest - the plugins.txt of the FromSoft world - so it is
# regenerated from the install records after every install, toggle and
# uninstall rather than edited in place.
#
# Mods live under the plugin's own runtime dir, never in the game folder:
# me3 boots the real exe (Game/eldenring.exe) instead of the anti-cheat
# launcher, and the deal we made is that the game install stays untouched
# and byte-identical to vanilla. Paths inside a .me3 file resolve relative
# to the file itself, so the whole tree is relocatable.

        Slay the Spire 2, 2026-08-13: a collection produced 1,078
        MissingMethodExceptions and killed the game five seconds into the
        main menu. The game's own log names the mod each exception was
        thrown IN - so the outdated ones are knowable, and switching them
        off is a tap rather than a hunt.

        Only mods the log blames DIRECTLY. _parse_mod_load_log attributes an
        exception to the first stack frame, not to the libraries beneath it,
        because a shared dependency appears in every trace as a victim and
        disabling it would take the working mods with it.

        Libraries other mods depend on are named as still-erroring rather
        than switched off. BaseLib genuinely threw a HarmonyException in the
        session that killed the game, and five installed mods declare it as
        a dependency - their own manifests say so, so the plugin does not
        have to guess which mods are libraries. `protected_ids` is a second
        belt for games whose mods do not declare dependencies.

        `dry_run` returns exactly the same answer without touching anything,
        which is what the panel row is built from. The row saying "9 mods
        broke" and the button switching off 3 was its own bug.

        `auto_only` narrows this to the mods no judgement is needed on, for
        acting without being asked: see _AUTO_DISABLE_FLOOD.

        Michael asked for this months ago and was talked out of it. One day
        of testing Slay the Spire 2 settled the argument: two mods silently
        did not load for want of a library, a collection's pinned libraries
        broke four more, mods were switched off that had fixes published,
        and a collection listed mods Nexus no longer serves. Every one of
        those was knowable, and none of it appeared anywhere a player looks.

        Checks each installed mod against what its Nexus page says it
        needs - other mods, and game DLC. The DLC half is the one that
        matters most for Bethesda games, where a missing expansion is not
        discoverable until the game refuses to start, and where Michael
        lost a day to exactly that on New Vegas.

        Where the game keeps a log we can read, what the game said beats
        what a mod page implies. Welcome to Night City installs 283 mods and
        deliberately omits seven the pages call required; it boots, and its
        script stack compiles clean. Those seven are the curator's decision,
        not a fault - and one of them, General Shadows Fixes, is the mod
        whose script was breaking the game. Reported as problems, they sent
        Michael to install the cause of the fault. So a requirement a
        collection left out is only a problem when the game complains about
        it, and Stardew is the case that proves it cuts both ways: SMAPI's
        log confirmed a collection there genuinely had left out something
        needed.
