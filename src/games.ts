    //
    //   - All three BLSE entry points die under wine-mono with a
    //     TypeLoadException for 0Harmony, because Mono resolves the field
    //     type eagerly, before BLSE's own assembly resolver exists.
    //   - MONO_PATH pointed at the Harmony MODULE's bin dir fixes it, and
    //     because the assembly then loads from the path the Harmony module
    //     expects, the "loaded from another location" warning never fires.
    //   - Delivered via a backend-written script at a no-space path, because
    //     decky-launch-options mangles quoted env assignments and the game
    //     path has spaces. The script swaps the exe AND sets MONO_PATH, and
    //     falls back to a vanilla boot if Harmony or BLSE is missing - a
    //     missing dependency must never produce an unbootable game.
    //
    // {blse_script} is substituted from game_status, which also (re)writes
    // the script, so the options never point at a file that does not exist.
